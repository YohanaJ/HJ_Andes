# Andean Ecoregion Floras Homogenization Analysis

This repository contains R code and data used for the analysis described in the paper:

**Homogenization and differentiation of Andean ecoregion floras driven by non-native plants: the role of political and environmental factors**

This study examines whether non-native plants drive floristic homogenization or differentiation among Andean ecoregions and explores the relationship of these patterns with geographic, climatic, and political variables.
